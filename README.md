# cider-spy-nrepl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonpither/cider-spy-nrepl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonpither/cider-spy-nrepl)

## Middleware

Required Middleware to support
[cider-spy](https://github.com/jonpither/cider-spy). Also runs standalone to
act as a hub for cider-spy-nrepls to communicate with each other.

### Basic configuration

    :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[cider-spy/cider-spy-nrepl "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
                     :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cider-spy-nrepl.middleware.cider-spy/wrap-cider-spy
                                                       cider-spy-nrepl.middleware.cider-spy-hub/wrap-cider-spy-hub
                                                       cider-spy-nrepl.middleware.cider-spy-multi-repl/wrap-multi-repl]}}}
## Hub

Communicate and track fellow REPL hackers by running a hub:

`lein run`

Add a `.cider-spy-hub.clj` file to your project to tell the middleware
where the hub is:

    {:cider-spy-hub-host "localhost"
     :cider-spy-hub-port 7771}

## Config

Add the config `CIDER_SPY_ALIAS` so that [`environ`](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) can see it.

## Developing

It's extremely useful to make `core` a lein checkouts dependency of `example-project`.
