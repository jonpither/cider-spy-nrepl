# cider-spy-nrepl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonpither/cider-spy-nrepl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonpither/cider-spy-nrepl)

## Middleware

Required Middleware to support [cider-spy](https://github.com/jonpither/cider-spy). Also runs standalone to act as a hub for cider-spy-nrepls to communicate with each other.

### Basic configuration

    :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[cider-spy/cider-spy-nrepl "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
                     :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cider-spy-nrepl.middleware.cider-spy/wrap-cider-spy
                                                       cider-spy-nrepl.middleware.cider-spy-hub/wrap-cider-spy-hub]}}}
## Hub

Communicate and track fellow REPL hackers by running a hub:

`lein run`

Add a `.cider-spy-hub.clj` file to your project to tell the middleware where the hub is:

    {:cider-spy-hub-host "localhost"
     :cider-spy-hub-port 7771}
